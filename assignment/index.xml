        <description>The purpose of this is assignment is to get familiar with the tools that we will be using in COMP 426 for the rest of the semester as well as the assignment submission process.
Note that this first assignment, a00, is graded only for completion. Future assignments will be much deeper in scope, and you should expect to spend significantly more time on them.
Install Required Software Below are links to guides for installing the required software for this course.</description>

        <title>a01 HTML and CSS</title>

        <description>In this assignment, we will create a set of HTML pages that are styled using CSS.
Follow the GitHub Classroom link for a01 listed on Piazza and Sakai. Clone the repository that it sets up for you. Just like last time, there will only be LICENSE AND README.md files in the repository when you clone it. You will create the rest of the files referenced below.
These pages should describe a mythological character or mythological story.</description>

        <description>Directly writing raw, static HTML and CSS is feasible for smaller sites like the mythical one you designed for a01. But it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see how designing a website from scratch can be difficult&amp;mdash;especially for large, complex, dynamic sites containing many pages.
And although every website you have ever used is ultimately expressed in terms of CSS and HTML, modern web developers typically have many tools at their disposal to help organize the code, reduce unnecessary duplication, and promote best practices.</description>

        <title>a03 JS Functions</title>

        <description>While writing HTML and CSS is necessary for making websites, the technolgy that does a lot of the behind-the-curtain work is JavaScript. It is the backbone of every modern web framework and is a necessity for makng interactive web pages.
This assignment, however, wont be using a web browser at all. When we want to execute JavaScript outside of the browser environment we use Node.js. This makes writing JavaScript like writing any other programming language.</description>

        <title>a04 Build an API from scratch</title>
        <link>https://comp426.johndmart.in/assignment/a04/</link>

        <description>In this assignment, we will build, from scratch, an API that talks to a database of users. Eventually, we will use this method (and this exact database) to add authentication to a page that you previously created in a01. This is all a lot easier than it seems at first.
There are a few basic concepts germane to this assignment that you will want to familiarize yourself with:
 REST (REpresentational State Transfer) CRUD (Create / Read / Update / Delete) SQL (Structured Query Language)  These concepts are explained in some detail in mod04, so you&amp;rsquo;ll want to have a look at that while we are working.</description>
