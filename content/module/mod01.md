# HTML and CSS

The first real assignment is meant to get you comfortable with the basics of HTML and CSS.
Whether you know it very well already or if you need a refresher, going through this module and then [a01](assignment/a01) should put you in a good position to continue through the rest of the assignments. 

Knowing these markup languages is *very* important for being a good web developer.
Both HTML and CSS are straightforward and well-documented.

Web langauges and platforms and frameworks change very rapidly and you will, as a web developer, spend a career learning new languages and platforms and frameworks.
You will _constantly_ be learning and teaching yourself new things.
If you take no other lessons away from this class, take this one: get comfortable looking things up and learning things on your own.
It is the only way.

The list of resources belows, for example, are the kinds of things that you will want to learn how to find online.
Google.
Everything.

HTML describes the web page's structure while CSS describes how that structure should be styled.
We are going to provide you a short online course so you can familiarize yourself with these two languages.
In the second (after the initial setup) assignment we will be making a simple website using just HTML and CSS.
Remember all the assignments are already published so you can look ahead and see what kinds of things you will be expected to do.

If you find anything overly confusing, ask on Piazza or reach out during office hours.
We will be making it very clear what you will be expected to know for a test when it comes time for that.
If you can do the upcoming HTML and CSS assignment [a01](assignment/a01) without looking things up, then you can consider yourself a genius-level expert.
If you can complete [a01](assignment/a01) while referencing the endless trove of documentation available online, then you are like the rest of us and have a pretty decent working knowledge that is good enough to do web development.

HTML and CSS is probably the most googleable topic you will ever come across in your CS career.
Don't be afraid to look things up, but make sure you aren't just copy-pasting things from Stack Overflow either. 

# Recommendations for self Study

## Code Academy

[CodeAcademy - Learn HTML and CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css)

You will have to sign up for an account, but it is totally free. You should complete the following tutorials:

### HTML

1. Elements and Structure
2. Tables (know the basics)
3. Forms (know the basics there will be an assignment on this later)

3. Display and Positioning
4. Colors (optional)

## w3schools

The [w3schools](w3schools.com) site is an _excellent_ resource for the markup and programming languages that we will be using in this course.
Get comfortable working through the tutorials both as self-study resource and as a reference tool.
- [w3schools HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
- [w3schools CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)

## Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)

The [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) has excellent guides and documentation on all things related to web development.
- [MDN HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) 
- [MDN CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).

## TutorialsPoint

For those of you who just want to read things I'd check out TutorialsPoint's pages on [HTML](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/index.htm) and [CSS](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/index.htm). I don't think the CSS one is very good and you would be better off with the Code Academy one.

# Assessment

There is no graded assessment component for course modules.
We will not be giving you graded quizzes or anything.
However, it will be effectively impossible to successfully work through any aspect of this course going forward without famililarity manipulating, writing, and editing HTML and CSS.

Here is a list of online quizzes that you can and should take on your own to test and evaluate your knowledge.
It would behoove you to take these quizzes and then review things that you find difficult.
Practice.
