10. Adding, committing, and pushing your changes
11. Troubleshooting the output from autograders on GitHub

### Notes

#### Installing NVM

If you install NVM using the supremely straightforward instructions linked below, don't make the mistake of over-thinking it the way that your instructor did today.

The only reason that it did not work was that I needed to exit and reload the terminal OR I could have run `source ~/.bashrc` and it would have reloaded my path so that the `nvm` command would run properly.
I just didn't read the next set of instructions about doing exactly that.

So, learn from my mistakes.

I'll demo NVM on Thursday and we can troubleshoot a version mismatch issue.

#### Ports

Similarly, the issue that I had displaying a test page served by `browser-sync` would have been easily dealt with if I had thought about it for a minute.

When I set the firewall up initially, it was to serve only to requests coming from high-number ports from a specific address (the address in my home) and I forgot about that immediately after doing it, of course.
So that is fixed now and we'll be able to proceed with demos.

If you are interested in learning more about what ports do for us, see the link below. 

Also, if you are interested in learning to set up a remote server for running things like this, I can post a tutorial.
It is relatively easy and nice to have some experience working on remote servers.
