### Notes

JavaScript was invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich.

In 1996, it was developed into a standard scripting langage by ECMA's (then the European Computer Manufacturers Association) Technical Committe (TC39) and released as ECMAScript 1 (ES1) in 1997.

TypeScript was developed and released by MicroSoft in 2012 to deal with some of the deficits of JS as a programming language.

It is technically a superset of ES6 (which is a superset of ES5). 

The current release of TypeScript (TS4.5) incorporates ES2022 modules and is supported by Node.js 16.x.x.
