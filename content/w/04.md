## Collaborative workflows

`2022-02-08T15:30:00-05:00`

Today we are mostly going to spend class time orienting ourselves within a99 teams and beginning a brainstorming session with your team.

At the beginning of today's session, I will go over the tools that I want you to use in GitHub to get yourselves into a collaborative workflow habit.
