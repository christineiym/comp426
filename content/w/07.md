### Notes

In class on Tuesday, we were working through writing an access log to a file instead of just echoing to STDOUT.

We were going in the right direction, but time ran out... and we were kind of overthinking things.

`morgan()` takes two arguments: a log type and an object with options.

In our case, we wanted to [write the log output to a stream using the FS module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan#write-logs-to-a-file).

The end result would be this: 

```server.js
...
// Use morgan for logging to files
// Create a write stream to append to an access.log file
const accessLog = fs.createWriteStream('access.log', { flags: 'a' })
// Set up the access logging middleware
app.use(morgan('combined', { stream: accessLog }))
...
```

## Databases

### Agenda

2. When to use a database
3. Making your API talk to a database

### Notes

Right at the end of the session today when I tried to run our new `database.js` script, it caught an error and we were out of time so I didn't want to run it down right then.
The error looked like this:

```
john@code:~/comp426/a04-draft$ node server.js
Log database appears to be empty. Creating log database...

/home/john/comp426/a04-draft/node_modules/better-sqlite3/lib/methods/wrappers.js:9
        this[cppdb].exec(sql);
                    ^
SqliteError: near "-": syntax error
    at Database.exec (/home/john/comp426/a04-draft/node_modules/better-sqlite3/lib/methods/wrappers.js:9:14)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/john/comp426/a04-draft/database.js:14:11)
    at Module._compile (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1101:14)
    at Object.Module._extensions..js (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1153:10)
    at Module.load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:981:32)
    at Function.Module._load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:822:12)
    at Module.require (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1005:19)
    at require (node:internal/modules/cjs/helpers:102:18)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/john/comp426/a04-draft/server.js:5:15)
    at Module._compile (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1101:14) {
  code: 'SQLITE_ERROR'
}
```

And my script looked like this: 

```database.js
const database = require('better-sqlite3')

const logdb = new database('log.db')

const stmt = logdb.prepare(`SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' and name='access';`)
let row = stmt.get();
if (row === undefined) {
    console.log('Log database appears to be empty. Creating log database...')

    const sqlInit = `
        CREATE TABLE access ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, remote-addr VARCHAR, remote-user VARCHAR, datetime VARCHAR, method VARCHAR, url VARCHAR, http-version NUMERIC, status INTEGER, content-length NUMERIC);
    `

    logdb.exec(sqlInit)
} else {
    console.log('Log database exists.')
}


module.exports = logdb
```

The relevant piece of the error log is: 

```
...
SqliteError: near "-": syntax error
...
    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/john/comp426/a04-draft/database.js:14:11)
```

This means that I have a SQLite syntax error on line 14 at position 11, which is a reference to the `const` named `sqlInit`.
And THAT has a hyphen (`"-"`) in it, which is a syntax error.

Why?

Because in SQL syntax, a hyphen is an operator and we can't use it in variable names... and we have several.

SO, what our script should look like instead is:

```database.js
const database = require('better-sqlite3')

const logdb = new database('log.db')

const stmt = logdb.prepare(`SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' and name='access';`)
let row = stmt.get();
if (row === undefined) {
    console.log('Log database appears to be empty. Creating log database...')

    const sqlInit = `
        CREATE TABLE accesslog ( 
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
            remote_addr VARCHAR, 
            remote_user VARCHAR, 
            date VARCHAR, 
            method VARCHAR, 
            url VARCHAR, 
            http_version NUMERIC, 
            status INTEGER, 
            content_length NUMERIC,
            referrer_url VARCHAR,
            user_agent VARCHAR
        );
    `

    logdb.exec(sqlInit)
} else {
    console.log('Log database exists.')
}

module.exports = logdb
```

Replacing the hyphens with underscores (snake case) makes our field names work properly.

The above script will check for an access log table in a database, and if it doesn't exist, it will initialize the DB and create a table that will hold all of the relevant pieces of information to be able to reproduce a combined log entry.
