## Modern Web Programming

In this course, we will take a very practical, hands-on approach to learning how to design, build, and interact with web APIs, back-end server applications, and front-end client apps and interfaces.

We will also focus on learning some "soft skills" that often go by the wayside, including collaborative development workflows, project management, understanding errors, writing documentation, and maintaining healthy work practices.
We will discuss licensing and make use of and operate within open source ecosystems.

Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we will focus our attention on apps and systems that handle public health information.
After years of dealing with this crisis, institutions still struggle with collecting, distributing, and managing information about COVID-19.
We will work on ways to address that.

## IMPORTANT

The first several sessions of Spring 2022 will be held remotely on Zoom.
Please use the Zoom Live link below.
The password is in Sakai.

***Do not come to the physical classroom in-person until instructed to do so.***
