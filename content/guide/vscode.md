## Getting started guides

This is a great series of video tutorials to help you get started using VSCode: 

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos

I recommend starting with the first one and working your way through until you are comfortable using the various features in VSCode.

Each video guide links out to other helpful information as well.

## WSL in VSCode

The [Windows Subsystem for Linux]() allows you to set up a Linux development environment without installing a virtual machine or manually setting up a separate container. These guides will help you get started installing and using it in VSCode:

[Use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/develop-cloud/wsl)

[Remote development in WSL](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl-tutorial)

I recommend installing Debian as the Linux distro for your subsystem to run.

### Other WSL resources

[Get started with the Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/get-started-with-windows-subsystem-for-linux/). This MS tutorial will teach you everything you need to know about WSL in 1.5 hours.
