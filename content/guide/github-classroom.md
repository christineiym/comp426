**GitHub Classroom** allows your instructors to distribute starter code for assignments, automatically create and manage repositories for student work, and automatically grade work sumbitted by push to GitHub.
This is how all assignments will be managed for COMP426.

You can install an extension in VSCode that will let you simplify the process of accepting and submitting assignments.
