**Bash** is the name of the shell and command language that we use most frequently in Linux and other UNIX clones.
Mac OSX is a UNIX clone.
When you open "Terminal," you are looking at Bash. 
It is a text-interface command line envrionment but it can also read commands from files in the form of scripts.
