**GitHub Actions** allows for testing, compiling, and other workflow tasks to be performed *on* GitHub after you push to a repository housed there.
COMP 426 uses these for autograding and other basic evaluation of assignments when you submit them.
It is useful to become familiar with how it works so that you can monitor your autograded assignments when you submit them.
