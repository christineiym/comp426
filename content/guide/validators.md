Here are some links to validators that you can use to check your assignment code. 
We will run all your code through a validator as part of your assignment submission. 
You should too.

Validators will tell you exactly what you need to know to fix the errors in your code.

## HTML, CSS, etc.

[W3C Markup Validation Service (HTML)](https://validator.w3.org/)

W3C has a bunch of different validators that can check CSS, web platforms (mobile ready), dead links, RSS, and one that checks all of these things.
