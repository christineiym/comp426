## Choosing licenses

Choosing a license for your work can seem daunting, but it is a matter of deciding what you want to be able to do with your content or source code and how you want it to be distributed. 

### GitHub

GitHub has a very good guide to choosing licenses for your repositories and also a tool to help you through the process. 

[Customize your repository > Licensing a repository - GitHub Docs)[https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository]

### Node.js

This is a *very* thorough article about applying licenses to NPM dependencies and JS development.

## Licenses for content

If you are building web applications that incorporate content, then you need to consider how that content it licensed.
You may want or need to build in capacity for setting different licenses for different content. 
You may want to license various content related to your app. 

In any case, it is good to be aware of how licenses for content work and how you can use them.

[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org) is a good place to start. CC has a helpful license chooser that you can use to select a license based on how you want your content to be used.

### Licenses for software

Ultimately, software (in the form of source code) is content. 
There is no special difference between licensing for content v. source, aside from the way that these licenses are used in practice.

### Copyleft

"Copyleft" is a play on "copyright" and intended to express the opposite.
If copyright preserves rights for written copy, then copyleft waives them (either partially or completely). 
Where copyright is restrictive, copyleft is permissive.
