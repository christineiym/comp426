This is an optional/informational assignment intended to help you integrate some of the work from previous assignments in support of your final project.
This assignment is ungraded.

The instructions are pretty simple.

The starter repo intentional has nothing in it.
You should copy your completed a04 code into the new repo for a05.

## Forms and requests

The purpose of this assignment is to create an HTML form to add a user to your database.
The form itself is simple. 
The actual interaction will happen in JS behind the scene. 

The objectives are as follows:

1. Create a form with the following fields:
	1. user
	2. pass
	3. email
2. Use `XMLHttpRequest()` or `fetch()` to send the information that a user inputs into that form to your database
3. Update your database script to handle email in records. 

Everything you need to be able to do this is in the following MDN tutorial.
