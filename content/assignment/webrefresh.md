---# HTML and CSS

In past semesters we have spent several class periods covering the basics of HTML and CSS. Knowing these languages (not considered programming languages) is very important for being a good web developer. Both HTML and CSS are straightforward and well documented. We are going to skip teaching them in class to spend more time on the stuff students actually find difficult.

HTML describes the web page's structure while CSS describes how that structure should be styled. We are going to provide you a short online course so you can familiarize yourself with these two languages. In the second (after the initial setup) assignment we will be making a simple website using just HTML and CSS. Remember all the assignments are already published so you can look ahead and see what kinds of things you will be expected to do.

We are essentially expecting you to teach yourself HTML and CSS if you are not already familiar. If you find anything overly confusing reach out at office hours or ask on Piazza. We will be making it very clear what you will be expected to know for a test when it comes time for that. If you can do the first assignment without constantly looking things up you can consider yourself an expert.

HTML and CSS is probably the most googleable topic you will ever come across in your CS career. Don't be afraid to look things up, but make sure you aren't just copy-pasting things from Stack Overflow either. 

## Our recommendation

[CodeAcademy - Learn HTML and CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css)

You will have to sign up for an account, but it is totally free. You should complete the following tutorials:

### HTML

1. Elements and Structure
2. Tables (know the basics)
3. Forms (know the basics there will be an assignment on this later)
4. Semantic HTML (optional and not required, just make yourself familiar with it so you can sound smart if you see it at a job)

### CSS

1. Selectors and Visual Rules
2. The Box Model
3. Display and Positioning
4. Colors (optional)
5. Typography (optional)
6. Grid (Skip this and learn basic [Flex](https://flexboxfroggy.com/))
7. CSS Transitions (optional)

## Other Options

1. Your best friend this semester should be the Mozilla Developer Network / MDN Web Docs. They have excellent guides and documentation on all things web dev. [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).

2. For those of you who just want to read things I'd check out TutorialsPoint's pages on [HTML](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/index.htm) and [CSS](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/index.htm). I don't think the CSS one is very good and you would be better off with the Code Academy one.

3. Another option is reading the W3 guides [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp).

## Assessment

We will be releasing a short Gradescope quiz in the coming weeks that you will be expected to take as proof of knowledge of HTML and CSS. A Sakai announcement will be sent and it will be mentioned in class when it is available. You can take it whenever you wish once it is available. There will be no close date.
