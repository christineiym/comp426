# Assignment 1

In this assignment, we will create a set of HTML pages that are styled using CSS.

These pages should describe a mythological character or mythological story. The term "mythological" can be broadly interpreted and can be from any culture or time period (Greek, Roman, Aztek, Norse, Asian) or even a very loose interpretation as in describing the "mythological" 1982 Big Game between Cal and Stanford. The content doesn't really matter. You are encouraged to use images and video but aren't required to do so.

> For ease of development, you are encouraged to use the [browser-sync](https://www.browsersync.io/) npm plugin from [assignment 0](https://comp426.com/assignments/a00#3.2%20Install%20Browsersync). Remember that all of your work (and commands) should be done inside of the a01 folder in your workspace. 


## Making a Simple Website

The only real requirements for this assignment are these:

1. There should be a single logical "starting" web page.
2. There should be at least 3 pages. There is no maximum limit of pages, but don't go crazy.
3. There should be links that navigate between the pages
4. All of the pages should use the same CSS stylesheet

### HTML

The starting, or home page, for this assignment should be titled `index.html`. This is a standard in web development because it allows the server to render it without specify which file you want to view ([why index.html](https://www.lifewire.com/index-html-page-3466505)). This root page will then link to other html pages. These can be named whatever you like. 

All of your html pages should be valid HTML5 ([html validator](http://validator.w3.org/)). Minor warnings about browser incompatibility are OK.

### CSS

This is the part of the assignment where you can get creative. Googling examples of css and best practices is a great place to start. Especially for this assignment [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) is going to be your best friend. 

At a minimum, your stylesheet should:

1. Have at least 10 selectors
2. Use two or more fonts for different kinds of content
3. Set the background color of some elements, specifying the color by hex notation
4. Set the border of some elements
5. Use the :hover pseudo-class for one or more elements
6. Use at least one class-based selector
7. Use at least one id-based selector
8. Have at least one selector rely on the hierarchical relationship between two elements
9. Use width and/or height to control the geometry of an element
10. Validate as CSS3 using the W3C CSS validation tool ([css-validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/))

Other than these basic features, feel free to use whatever CSS3 attributes you would like. 

## Disclaimer

Do not use any CSS preprocessors or libraries (e.g. Bootstrap, Bulma, etc.). You are required to write all of the css yourself. Later assignments will deal with using these libraries.
