In total, there will be 11 programming assignments including this one, an HTML refresher (not graded), and a final term project.
All assignments will be released early in the semester.

**You can and should work on the assignments at your own pace.**
Any due dates are there to guide you as to roughly where you should be relative to the time remaining in the semester.

These assignments were specifically designed to augment and apply materials that will be covered in the [modules](modules).
Some assignments will introduce important new material that isn't directly covered in class.
To be successful in COMP 426, it is crucial to keep up with submitting assignments regularly and plan for the future assignments.
Since the course is asynchronous and self-directed, it can be easy to get behind or feel overwhelmed. 
We will try to focus on workflow management and planning practices in this class, since they are not usually explicitly taught. 

## Assignment submission and grading

You will submit all assignments through GitHub classroom.
Instructions for setting this up are in the instructions for the first assignment.
Most of the assignments will be autograded, meaning you will get near-instant feedback about your grade as you are working.
You may resubmit autograded assignments as many times as you wish, so feel free to keep trying until you get it right. 
A few assignments will be manually graded. 
Manually graded assignments will only be graded one time, after their respective due dates. 

**Working with other students on assignments is strictly prohibited**. 
Do your own work.
Do not copy and paste the work of others.

## Final term project

The final assignment for COMP 426 is a term project which you will complete as part of a team. 
Students will work together in small teams (5-6 per team) to design and debug a single term project. 
Each team membersâ€™s contribution to the project must be the result of their own individual effort. 
Be careful that you do not submit any code that you did not personally write. 
**Submitting code copied from others or from the internet may result in your submission being flagged by the system for plagiarism**.

See the [final project page](assignment/a99) for more information and instructions for the final term project.
