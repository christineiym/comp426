## Overview

As a small team, you will create an app that has users and that tracks some information related to the those users.
The app will be fully documented, including setup instructions, full API documentation, and user instructions, as well as your planning workflow.

The final product is due on the day set for the final exam by the university.

## Deliverables

A GitHub repository containing your code and documentation

The code should incorporate the following:

1. Back-end specifications
	1. API built on whatever framework you choose.
	2. API root endpoint at `http://HOST/app/`.
	2. Should create (if nonexistent) and interact with a database of users and interactions. These can be separate databases or separate tables in one database.
	3. Database can be of any type you choose.
2. Front-end specifications
	1. Give users the ability to register an account, update their information, see their information somewhere, and delete their account.
	2. Interactions with the front end should be logged in a database. 
3. Database specifications
	1. User database - registration details (username, password, email address, etc.)
	2. Interaction database - details of user interactions (login history, gameplay history, save points, scores, etc.)
4. Documentation
	1. Full documentation of every available API endpoint
	2. Code comments (preferably referring to the documentation)
	3. User instructions
5. Demo
6. Self/group evaluation
